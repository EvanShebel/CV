  <h3>Current Frame design </h3><br>

<p>Sand Helper is a company that produces a specialized electirc wheelchair to provide beach access for anyone with mobility issues.
	<br>
	The current frame design uses angle iron to build a perimeter chassis with 3 levels. The lower level is the jackshaft chain drive.
	Above that the motors are mounted along with the electronics. Above that is the seat and battery box.
	<br>
	There is a huge cost benefit to using angle iron, however it is labor intensive and no two frames are exact.

  <h3>Redesign frame for manufacturability and improve durability</h3><br>

<!--   <ul> -->
	  <li>
    My redesign attempts to improve manufacturability by creating symmetrical sub-assemblies. The sub-assemblies are made from sheet metal, where all mounting 
    holes are pre-cut. 
	  </li>
	  <li>
The sheet metal parts are designed and bent to serve as many functions as possible to reduce part count during assembly. Some components have 
	been relocated as well. I moved the seat farther forward and made it lower to help those that are mobility impaired get in and out. 
		  </li>
    <li>
    Another aspect of the redesign is the drivetrain. Currently, the chair uses motors and a chain-driven jackshaft to drive each side's wheels. The chain 
    necessitates having slack and a tension adjustment mechanism, which requires frequent maintenance. Additionally, the chain and sprockets wear quickly 
    due to sand abrasion.
    </li>
	  <li>My suggestion was to use a sealed worm gearbox, typically found on conveyors or in industrial machinery.
	  </li>
	  <li>Finally, I suggested using
    a Pelican waterproof case to house the electronics, as they are currently not enclosed.
