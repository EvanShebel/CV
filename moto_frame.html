		<p> This motorcycle design for an electric vehicle architecture is successive to my design for an <a href="./dirt.html">electric dirtbike</a>. The impetus for 
		this project was a reservation that I may not be successful in patenting the dirtbike idea, and so to protect the idea before I have the chance to 
		build it, and still demonstrate what I had learned in the process, I attempted to replicate the innovation in a tangential category. My
		reservation, unfortunatley, proved to be merited as I was not be able to pursue a non-provisional patent for this design due to cost. However, I 
		view this design project as being successful as it demonstrates my capabilites to innovate and apply novel solutions to 	design etc.
		</p>
		<p>
		While the electric motorcycle niche is currently small and comprising of boutique brands permiting the investigation and formulation of new and unique designs 
		that may seem to be obvious, simple, or low hanging fruit in retrospect; the corverse of this then means that there is also little to reference in terms of
		itterative design. Meaning that designs must necessarily be revolutionary and require a macro sense in understanding 
		the integration and utilization of all of the comprising components. Further expanding on how I applied this point should prove to be the main differentiator between my design 
		and the other patents I will list.

		In my attempt to complete a comprehensive search of related patents I found the most relevant and comparable patents
		to be from Mission Motorcycles, Energica, Alta, Saietta,
		and Kawasaki.
		</p>

		patent when I was devising how I wanted to structure my patent as theirs was the most thorough regarding the mentioning of the 
		ancilary 
		components and how the architecture was designed to incorporate them. 
		</p>
		

		<p>
		A brief summary of the Mission Motors bike: It uses a vertically oriented monolithic 
		battery that is located 
		forward of the motor and transmission. The battery is also a stressed member of a trellis frame that connects between a headstock, forward of the battery, and 
		a drive unit assembly, rearward of the battery. 
		</p>
		
		<img src="./renders/reference/mission.jpg" alt="Image" align="middle" style="width:35%">

		Mission Motorcycles
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The Mission patent has four independent claims. Paraphrasing, the first and second claims regard the components of the frame and their relative geometric 
		location. The third claim regards how the battery adds structural rigidity to the assembled motorcycle. The fourth regards the battery being two modules
		symmetric about an integrated support structure that fastens to the trellis exterior frame, and further talks about how the motorcycle is assembled. 
		</p>	
		<p>
		Contrasting the Mission desgin with my own, the Mission desgin required that the battery be easily removed, and thus the design was necessitted compromise
		to accomodate this. I view needing a traditional perimeter frame as a compromise and a monocoque design to be a more effective solution. However, 
		since Mission felt it warrented to have a traditional frame, it prompted a battery geometry that can fit within the external frame. This explains their choice 
		for a simple rectangular battery using prismatic cells.
		</p>
		<p>
		Utilizing the available space for a motorcycle to locate batteries is a challenge and the designs I referenced choose beween using off the shelf 
		rectangular prismatic battery cells which would result in a large monoilthic rectangular battery, or using cylindrical cells which can be arranged into a more 
		organic shape to better fit within the rider ergonomics but may sacrifice energy density.
		</p>
		<p>
		My design incorporates the positives from either choice, using prismatic cells that provide greater energy density, and arranging them to have equal or better 
		on board energy storage in an way that remains ergonomic to the rider.
		
		cylindrical cells have better thermal and abuse performance the packagin requirements 
		are more stringent compared to a car.
		
		vertial battery mounting vs longitudinal. the most significant and unique design aspect that differentiates my design. placing the batteries along a longitudinal axis 
		allowed for

		is interesting as they explored the potential of the monocoque design and had an inclined battery. However the encompasing battery structure remained monolithic
		and was inclined along the conventional axis between headstock and swingarm pivot.

		An electric motorcycle that disposes batteries 'forward and above' the motor. I did not believe this to affect my design being unique as my design was 
		specific in having batteries inclined at a certain angle, and having modules orthognonal to one another resulting in a specific orientation.

		<p>
		Mission motorcycles, Energica, and Mugen all subscribe to a simmilar design philosophy of a vertical monolithic battery pack that is supported by an external 
		frame with a drive unit assembly mounted contiguous to the rear face of the battery pack.
		</p>
		
		
		
		<p>
		The Empulse and Saietta can be grouped as well since they use the same battery orientation. The difference being that Saietta uses a monocoque and the Empulse
		relies on an external frame.
		</p>
		
		
		
		<p>
		You may notice that the Motoczysz motorcycle has its batteries inclined at an angle that is similar to my design. As I am only able to make assumptions 
		about Michael Czysz's 
		intentions, I would guess the batttery arrangement is the way it is to clear the front wheel at full compression and possibly needed to locate the coilover
		springs above the batteries like is show on the Amarok P1.
		
		If my guesses are assumed correct, then the functionality and implementation of .. are entirley seperate. 
		
		Key differences being that the batteries remain substantially vertically oriented and entirely in front of the motor. It should be noted that the 2013 
		iteration of the Motoczysz C1 did implement batteries under the seat however it was not integrated into the frame and the orientation of the other batteries 
		did not change.
